# a Summery of what we learned today!

 - We Learned how to createand clone a Local Repos and Upload it to Github in the
   visual studio using  using the command curl <url> then <Add> <FileName> <commit -m "msg"> <push -u origin master>
   
   also we practiced switching between Branches and updating them using
   the command git checkout <branch name> .
   
   making changes to files in github and using  git pull command to be
   up to date !  gitting the idea of creating an empty  directories are
   not possible , because in the server it has the priority to upload a project with files.
